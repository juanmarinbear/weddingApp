    <div class="well">
      <p>Dulce and Juan met in college.  One day, Juan noticed Dulce was very sad, he approached and asked her what was wrong.  Dulce answered she was doing poorly in Calculus and needed an A in the final exam to not fail the class.</p>
      <p>Juan told Dulce not to worry, that he would help her.  He designed a hardcore study plan and spent with Dulce many days in the library doing every exercise in the book (plus some extra difficult ones Juan came up with).</p>
      <p>It was worth it.  Dulce got an A and did not fail the class.</p>
      <p>They stayed friends for the next year but then Juan transferred to Stanford and they stopped seeing each other.</p>
      <p>Many years later, they reconnected at Dulce’s graduation party.  They kept close contact even though Dulce was in Monterrey and Juan was in Mexico City.</p>
      <p>Eventually, Juan invited Dulce to work with him in Mexico City.  Dulce worked hard putting order in Juan’s business.</p>
      <p>One day, they were playing Rockband and drinking martinis…  They began dating.</p>
      <p>Now they hardly go anywhere without each other.  Juan is the happiest man in the world and Dulce has the love of her life.</p>
